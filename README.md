### Welcome to cechava's Github! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computational Neuroscientist with an enthusiasm for extracting insights from behavioral, physiological, and image data.

This github page cotains some of the work I have done during my time in neuroscience research at Harvard and MIT as well as some other portfolio projects. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* [Rectilinearity-Toolbox](https://github.com/cechava/Rectilinearity_Toolbox), a MATLAB-based image processing package to quantify the amount of rectilinear (right-angle) features in an image. I used this package to contribute to a [neuroscience journal publication](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/20/6721) showing that a region of the brain is particularly sensitive to the presence of rectilinear features which are ubiquitous in natural and man-made enviroments.
* [simple-eyetracker](https://github.com/cechava/minimal_eyetracker) A simple semi-supervised Python-based eye tracking software I developed to keep track of animal pupil dilation and eye movements in brain physiology experiments.
* [EMG-gestures](https://github.com/cechava/EMG_gestures) A deep learning-based package to decode hand gestures from electrical signals in the forearm (electromyography - EMG). The package also benchmarks different strategies for transferring learned callibrations across subjects.
